# 🚧 WORK IN PROGRESS! 🚧

I hope you like my repo name. 😎 Shoutout to Github Co-Pilot for the assist on these docs. 🤖 And I blame Github Co-Pilot for any errors in the docs. 😅 I could never. 🙌

If you see any issues with the documentation, please create an issue 🐛 or a pull request 🛠️. I'm always looking to improve my documentation 📚 and code 💻. I'm also open to suggestions 💡 on how to improve the documentation and code. I'm always looking to learn new things and new ways to do things. 📖✨

# 🏠 Homelab K8S Cluster with Cilium and Cloudflare 🛡️

Create your own Kubernetes cluster 🚀 with Cilium and Cloudflare. ☁️

The intention of this project is to not only share my code of my existing homelab 💾 but also to provide a guide on how to set up your own Kubernetes cluster with Cilium and Cloudflare. 🌐 This project is a culmination of my learnings 📚 from various sources and my own experiences. 🎓 I hope that this project will help others in their journey to learn Kubernetes and networking. 🌱

- 🕸️ Cilium for service mesh, envoy proxying, and network observability.
- 🌩️ Cloudflare for DNS and Zero Trust Access.
- 🔒 Cert-Manager for Let's Encrypt publicly signed certificates.
- 🧩 ExternalDNS for automatic DNS record creation on AdGuard Home DNS service.

## 🛠️ Minimum Requirements

The bare minimum requirements to run the core services ⚙️ and not any other applications.

### Between all 3 nodes:
- 💾 10 GBs - and that's really THE minimum. You will need more if you plan to run applications on the cluster. 📦
- 🧠 Any proc if you’re going to let it idle. 💤 CPU requirements really depend on what you are going to run on the cluster after setup. ⚙️
- 🖴 20 GBs of disk space. This is the minimum for the OS and the core services. 📀 You will need more if you plan to run applications on the cluster.

### Example usage of how much core services will use:
